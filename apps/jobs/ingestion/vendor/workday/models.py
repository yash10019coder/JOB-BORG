"""Core data models for jobs, companies, and salary information.

These models are the canonical schema across every ATS scraper and the
public dataset on storage.stapply.ai. Adding a field here means: the
dataset gets a new column, every scraper must populate it (or leave
it None), and the parquet schema gets a new field.

The Job schema is also documented for human readers in
``JOB_SCHEMA.md`` at the repo root — keep the two in sync. ``Field``
descriptions in this file are the source of truth; the markdown is a
view onto them.

class Job(BaseModel):
    """A job posting — the canonical row across the entire dataset.

    Every scraper produces ``Job`` instances; the public CSV/Parquet
    exports use these field names verbatim. **Backwards compatibility
    on field names is part of the public contract** — renaming a field
    is a breaking change.

    The fields fall into four groups, listed in the order they appear
    below:

    1. **Identity** (``global_id``, ``url``, ``title``, ``company``,
       ``ats_type``, ``ats_id``). What the row *is*.

    2. **Location** (``location``, ``country_iso``, ``region``,
       ``lat``, ``lon``, ``is_remote``). Where the role lives.
       ``is_remote`` is *narrowly* inferred from the ``title`` by
       ``jobhive.enrichment.infer_is_remote`` when the ATS doesn't
       surface a flag — it only ever returns ``True`` (never
       ``False``) so the absence of a marker doesn't get mis-classified
       as on-site. ``country_iso`` / ``region`` / ``lat`` / ``lon``
       are scraper-set when the source exposes them, otherwise filled
       by the downstream LLM enrichment pass / a geocoding service.

    3. **Compensation** (``salary_currency``, ``salary_period``,
       ``salary_summary``, ``salary_min``, ``salary_max``).
       ``salary_min`` / ``salary_max`` are *derived* from
       ``salary_summary`` via ``jobhive.enrichment.parse_salary_range``
       when the ATS exposes only free text.

    4. **Classification** (``experience``, ``employment_type``,
       ``department``, ``team``, ``requisition_id``, ``apply_url``,
       ``commitment``). Optional — set when the source API exposes
       them, ``None`` otherwise.

    5. **Content & timing** (``description``, ``posted_at``,
       ``fetched_at``, ``language``). ``language`` is the listing's
       locale code (ISO 639-1, e.g. ``en`` / ``fr``).

    6. **Provider-specific overflow** (``raw``): a JSON dict captured
       at scrape-time so we don't lose ATS-specific fields the
       canonical schema can't represent (Greenhouse ``metadata``
       custom fields, Bundesagentur ``arbeitszeit``/``branche``,
       Lever ``categories.*``, etc.).

    Heuristic-vs-LLM split: anything that requires reading prose
    (description text, location strings to derive country, …) is
    intentionally left to the downstream LLM enrichment pipeline.
    Hardcoded inference here is restricted to (a) cheap robust
    look-ups (employment-type label maps), (b) tight regex parsing
    on conventionally-structured text (``salary_summary``), and
    (c) a single title-only ``is_remote`` keyword check that only
    ever asserts ``True``.
